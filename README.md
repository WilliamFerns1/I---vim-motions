A **tribute page** for a dear lover of mine, Vim motions.

## Why I love Vim Motions?
1. More productive
2. More money, as a side effect of being more productive
3. Smarter, because being more productive leads to faster learning and applying.
4. Flex: I look like a 'G' in front of average VSCoders.
